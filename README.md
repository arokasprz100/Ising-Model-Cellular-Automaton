# Cellular-Automata-Projects

## Overview 
Projects created during my participation in the Cellular Automata course (AGH UST). Completion of the course consisted of two projects:

 * configurable *Life-like* cellular automaton - user can choose stay/born rules, board size and initial conditions (number of alive cells)

 * Ising model


## First project - Life-like automaton


## Second project - Ising model
